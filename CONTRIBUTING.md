# Contributor Code of Conduct
Hey there, thanks for your consideration to contribute to this project. This is a FOSS so transperency and collaboration is number one priority. 


## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the certain Software License

Check the project's licence for more information, as soon as you submit a pull-request, that means you agree that the code you just wrote will fall under that licence and you won't be able to claim the code back.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
